I have a solution that works 95% of the time with some post-processing of the diarization with pandas. My goal is to have zero overlaps in the final dataframe.

- First distinguish between full overlaps (like the 2 first in your example) and partial overlaps (like your last example at the end of first segment)
- General: Delete all segments that are shorter than 0.5 seconds (mostly "hmm" and short "yes" while the other speaker is speaking)
- Full overlap: Delete all segments that are shorter than 1 seconds (mostly speaking too soon and not continueing before 1st speaker finishes)
- Full overlap: Longer segments. I divide the longer segment into two, the shorter segment intercepts it and overwrites.
- Partial overlaps: If segment is less than 2 seconds, and overlaps more than 0.6 seconds -> delete (unnecessary interruptions at the end of the sentence)
- Partial overlaps longer: I modify end of first segment to a new value (start of 2nd segment)
